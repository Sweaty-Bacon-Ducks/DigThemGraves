Hi, and thank you for purchasing the Cute RPG UI Kit. Please look out for more packs from me, I have character, background, and UI Kits on Unity.

All PSDs are included with this file, so you can customize the menus colour in Photoshop if you wish. I've also included the PSDs for the buttons and icons. 

As for the Unity Package, I hope that it is straightforward. It includes prefabs for each icon, button, and custom prebuilt menus for most menus that you'd find in an RPG.

I also feel that it's important to mention that I'm not a programmer, so all UI elements are set up to the best of my ability. I do not know how to script menus to close and all of that. I am currently learning how so things like that may be included in a future update, but they are not now. 

If you have any questions or issues, please email me at Artbykandles@gmail.com. If you leave a comment on Unity, I might not see it right away. So please just send an email, I am willing to work with you to fix your problem, whatever if might be.

If you'd like to support me futher, please check out my patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Kandles
Patrons are given access to my activity feed, they're able to suggest which assets I make next, and they also get better deals on my assets.

Thank you again! Please enjoy! :)
