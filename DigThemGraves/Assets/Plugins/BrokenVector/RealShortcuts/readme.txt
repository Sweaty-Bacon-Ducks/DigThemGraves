REAL SHORTCUTS

Thank you for purchasing Real Shortcuts!

This editor plugin allows you, to create shortcuts, like links on your operating system.
To create one, just rightclick on the location in the Project Explorer where you want your shortcut to appear, and select Create->Shortcut.

After creating a shortcut, you can move and delete it like a normal file.
Please keep in mind, that this is just for the Unity Editor - it won't work outside and in code.

Please rate our product on the Unity Asset Store if you like it!
